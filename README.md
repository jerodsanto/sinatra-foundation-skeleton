# sinatra-foundation-skeleton

Just a skeleton [Sinatra][sinatra] application which utilizes Zurb's
[Foundation 3][foundation] responsive front-end framework. Oh, and it's also
wired up for easy [Heroku][heroku] deployment.

Simply fork, clone, or download the files to get started. Foundation's settings
are in `views/scss/_settings.scss`

Run it in dev mode:

     bundle exec shotgun config.ru
